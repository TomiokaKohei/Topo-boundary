# Enhanced-iCurb

Enhanced-iCurb is an improved version of our previous work iCurb. It proposes a more reasonable and effective algorithm to generate expert demonstrations to train the agent network. The above modification improves the final evaluation results and the quality of the qualitative visualizations.

## Experiment environment
Run 
```
./build_container.bash
``` 
to create the Docker container. 

## New feature: predicted initial vertices

In past experiments, we directly use gt initial vertices for fair comparison. Now we provide the code to predict initial vertices. Please first generate the initial vertices following steps in ```./graph_baseline_models/init_vertex```, then set ```gt_init_vertex``` in ```config.yml``` as ```False```. If you want to use the gt initial vertices for inference, set ```gt_init_vertex``` as ```True``` (default).

## Try with saved checkpoint
Run 
```
./run_eval.bash
```

Inference would be done with saved checkpoints. 

Binary maps of the generated graph are saved in ```./records/test/skeleton```; generated vertices are saved in ```./records/test/vertices_record```. After inference, a script is triggered to calculate the evaluation results of the inference. 

## Train your own model
### Training

Enhanced-iCurb has exactly the same training process as iCurb. First, run 
```
./run_train.bash
```

All the training parameters could be modified in the ```config.yml```.


If your need the visualization of the trajectories generated during the training period set ```visualization``` in ```config.yml``` to **True**, and check the visualizations in folder ```./records/train/vis```. 

### Tensorboard
Open another terminal and run 
```
docker exec -it topo_enhanced_iCurb bash
``` 
Then run 
```
./run_tensorboard.bash
``` 
The port number is **5009**.

### Inference
Run 
```
./run_eval.bash
```

Inference would be done with saved checkpoints. 

Binary maps of the generated graph are saved in ```./records/test/skeleton```; generated vertices are saved in ```./records/test/vertices_record```. After inference, a script is triggered to calculate the evaluation results of the inference. 



## Visualization in aerial images
If you want to project the generated road-boundary graph onto the aerial images for better visualization, run
```
python utils/visualize.py
```
Generated visualizations are saved in ```./records/test/final_vis```.

Some examples are shown below. Cyan lines are the ground truth. In the predicted road-boundary graph, yellow nodes are vertices and orange lines are edges. We can see good results, and the agent can produce more accurate corners (by using smaller step size).
